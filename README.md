## What Can This Do?
### As of now...
This will find you yard sales around Durham that are listed at [yardsalesearch.com](https://www.yardsalesearch.com).

### Big Plans...
* Compile yard sale locations and information from multiple sources
* Allow optional args specifying city, date, etc.
* Create an optimized route to hit up these yard sales
* Maybe this will have a front-end or API, one day... one day...
* Get bigger than Facebook and Google (combined)

## Development
While developing and testing, you can run commands like this:

```bash
mix run -e 'CheapoJoe.CLI.main(["--cities"])'
```

When you're ready to create a `cheapojoe` executable, just run this puppy:

```
mix escript.build
```

VoÃ­la! You should now be able to run `./cheapojoe --help` from your electronic computer terminal console area box.

## Tests
These would be a great idea!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cheapojoe` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cheapojoe, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
